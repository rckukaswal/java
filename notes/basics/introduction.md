# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## Key Features of Java

- **Platform Independent**: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- **Object-Oriented**: Follows OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Simple**: Easy to learn with a clean syntax
- **Secure**: Provides security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing
- **Multithreaded**: Supports concurrent programming
- **Robust**: Strong memory management and exception handling

## Java Environment Setup

To start programming in Java, you need:

1. **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Includes tools for developing Java applications
2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Needed to run Java applications
3. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

## Your First Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
