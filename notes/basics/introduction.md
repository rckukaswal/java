Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
Key Features of Java

Platform Independent: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Object-Oriented: Follows OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
Simple: Easy to learn with a clean syntax
Secure: Provides security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing
Multithreaded: Supports concurrent programming
Robust: Strong memory management and exception handling

Java Environment Setup
To start programming in Java, you need:

JDK (Java Development Kit): Includes tools for developing Java applications
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Needed to run Java applications
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

Your First Java Program
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

This simple program demonstrates:

Class declaration
Main method (entry point of Java applications)
Output to console using System.out.println()

How Java Works

Write Java code in .java files
Compile with javac compiler to create .class files (bytecode)
JVM executes the bytecode on any platform

Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy makes it highly versatile for various applications from web development to mobile apps.
